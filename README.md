# 😃 Emotion Detection from Text using NLP

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and deep learning to detect human emotions from raw text input. Given a sentence or message, the model predicts the underlying emotion — such as joy, anger, sadness, or fear.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a robust model that can:
- Analyze sentences and detect emotional tone
- Classify text into discrete emotions
- Be used in chatbots, mental health apps, feedback systems, etc.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- `emotion_detector.ipynb`: Full training and evaluation notebook
- `train.csv`, `test.csv`: Labeled dataset of text and associated emotion
- `requirements.txt`: All required Python packages
